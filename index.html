      <p>Hi, my name is Bobby Marshbanks, and thank you for visiting my page!</p>

      <p>I just finished University of Arizona's full stack web development bootcamp. What a challenging experience it was! I had a lot of help from the staff and my peers. 
          I tried to help others when I could and we all got through it together.
      </p>

      <p>Please click on my portfolio link to see the projects I have done and the progression that I have made. And if you have any questions please use my contact form. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
